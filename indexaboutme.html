  <h1 class="sectionTitle"> I'm Making a Career Change </h1>
    <p> I'm looking to switch into a career in tech. I'm coming from a retail management background, with strong experience in customer service and personnel management.</p>
  <p> I'm excited to dive in to the work of tech, especially from such a base as the Boston area! I'm inspired by the community, abundance of open-source projects and initiatives, and the start-up culture.</p>
  <p> I love to learn and expand my knowledge of all topics. I'm open to learning everything, which also makes me a deadly trivia player! </p>
